# Introduction

In the study of complex tissue samples, 
conventional collection and analysis methods may not always fulfill specific research needs or yield sufficiently detailed information. To bridge this gap,
researchers can use some advanced techniques and methods to obtain more comprehensive data and information. 
Notable among these are single-cell sequencing, 
spatial transcriptome and multi-omics methods. 
These cutting-edge tools provide deeper insights into the cellular and molecular intricacies of complex tissues, 
enabling a richer analysis beyond the capabilities of traditional methods. 
However, the inherent complexity of these samples has been computationally addressed through the development of a suite of methods known as expression deconvolution methods.

1. How to estimate mixing proportions?  

There are a number of existing methods 
devoted to solve this question. These methods mainly can be categorized 
to two groups: **reference-based** (require
pure cell type profiles) and **reference-free**
(does not require pure cell type profiles).
It has been found that reference-based 
deconvolution is more accurate and reliable
than reference-free deconvolution. 
However, the reference panels required 
for reference-based deconvolution can be 
difficult to obtain, thus reference-free method has wider application. 

<!-- * As subsequence of the first question, we ask,
how to construct reference panels from available 
single-cell studies if reference-based deconvolution
is used?   -->

2. with available mixing proportions, 
how to detect cell-type specific Gene expression?

the first step utilizes the Akaike Information Criterion (AICs) to select the appropriate number of cell types (). 
Following this, in the second step, and based on the estimated , 
we utilize previously developed cross-cell-type differential analysis to select cell type-specific features. 
Subsequently, our goal is to apply an algorithm to the benchmark dataset to identify simplexes with a tetrahedron (4-simplex) form;
here, the angles of the simplex provide information on the proportions of cell types in the mixture and cell type-specific genes. 
In the fourth step, 
we plan to use an available reference panel to assign labels to the estimated anonymous cell types; 
notably, even if this reference panel originates from a different population, 
our approach aims to accurately assign labels to the estimated anonymous cell types through a data-driven method. 
Finally, we generate a proportion matrix with cell type assignment labels. In the following sections,

<!-- In future works, we plan to add more 
components and expand our answers to the above questions.   -->


# Installation and quick start

## Install TsisalEXP
To install this package, start R (version "3.6") and enter:

installed.packages("TsisalEXP")

## How to get help for TsisalEXP

Any TsisalEXP questions should be posted
to the GitHub Issue section of TsisalEXP 
homepage at https://github.com/lingl456/TsisalEXP/issues.

## Quick start on detecting cell type-specific differential signals

Here we show the key steps for a cell 
type-specific different analysis. This 
code chunk assumes you have an expression
or Gene expression matrix called `Y_raw`,
a data frame of sample information called
`design`, and a table of cellular composition
(i.e. mixing proportions) 
called `prop`. Instead of a data matrix, 
`Y_raw` could also be a `SummarizedExperiment` object. 
If the cellular composition
is not available, the following sections 
will discuss about how to obtain mixing 
proportions using reference-free deconvolution 
or reference-based deconvolution.


# Example dataset

TOAST provides one sample dataset.

we generated pure tissue profiles and ratios based 
on input parameters a mixture of GEO (reg. no. GSE11058) immune cell lines,
resulting in a sample mixture. 
This dataset contains gene expression profiles from four immune cells, 
including Jurkat, IM-9, Raji, and THP-1, Furthermore, 
four immune cell lines were cultured individually or in mixtures of different relative proportions and run on microarrays.
```{r quick_start, eval = FALSE}
sim_data <- getSampleMix(N_sample = Nsample, logpure, logpure.sd, noise_sd = 0.1)
  Y.raw <- sim_data$obs.Y
  trueProp = sim_data$trueProp
  trueExp = sim_data$tmp
  K = ncol(trueProp)
```


Check matrix including beta values for 
3000 CpG by 100 samples.
```{r checkData}
dim(Y_raw) 
Y_raw[1:4,1:4]
```



```
# Estimate mixing proportions

# Perform deconvolution using the csDeconv function
# Input: Y.raw (gene expression matrix), K = 4 (number of cell types),
# TotalIter = 5 (number of iterations), bound_negative = TRUE (prevent negative values)
out.TsisalExp <- csDeconv(Y.raw, K = 4, TotalIter = 5, bound_negative = TRUE)

# Apply the mysisal method to refine the estimated proportions
# Use updated indices from csDeconv, number of cell types (K = 4), and select top 50 markers
res.TsisalExp <- mysisal(Y.raw[out.TsisalExp$updatedInx, ], K = 4, topN = 50)

# Normalize the estimated proportions so that each row sums to 1
estProp_TsisalExp <- t(apply(res.TsisalExp$estProp, 1, function(x) x / sum(x)))

# Handle cases where some columns (cell types) have all zeros
idx <- apply(estProp_TsisalExp, 2, function(x) sum(x) == 0)
estProp_TsisalExp[, idx] <- runif(ncol(estProp_TsisalExp), 0.0001, 0.0002)

# Align the estimated proportions with the reference (trueProp) for consistency
estProp_TsisalExp <- GetPropAligned(input = estProp_TsisalExp, reference = trueProp)

# Calculate the mean correlation (MC_TsisalExp) between the estimated and true proportions
MC_TsisalExp <- mean(diag(cor(estProp_TsisalExp, trueProp)))

# Calculate the mean absolute error (MAE_TsisalExp) between the estimated and true proportions
MAE_TsisalExp <- mean(colSums(abs(estProp_TsisalExp - trueProp)) / nrow(trueProp))

# Output MC_TsisalExp and MAE_TsisalExp
# - MC_TsisalExp measures the average correlation between estimated and true proportions.
# - MAE_TsisalExp measures the average deviation of the estimated proportions from the true proportions.

    ## In simulated Immune Cell Line Mixtures, TsisalEXP accurately calculates the number of cell types
    
    We initially assessed the accuracy of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 
    in ascertaining the number of cell types within mixed samples, 
    employing Immune Cell Line Mixtures for this purpose. 
    Following the outlined simulation procedure above, 
    we chose K=4 as the number of cell types and subsequently produced 100 mixed samples. 
    illustrates the AIC scores of Y for K ranging from 2 to 15.
    Consistent with our expectations, 
    we observed that the AIC value reaches its minimum when K equals 4, 
    thereby confirming our selection of K=4 as the optimal number of cell types 
    for these mixed samples.
    
    # Simulate data
  sim_data <- getSampleMix(
    N_sample = 30,
    logpure = logpure,
    logpure.sd = logpure.sd,
    noise_sd = 0.1
  )

  # Extract components from simulated data
  Y.raw <- sim_data$obs.Y        # Observed mixed data
  trueProp <- sim_data$trueProp  # True proportions
  trueExp <- sim_data$tmp        # True expression profiles
  K <- ncol(trueProp)            # Number of cell types

  # Cell-type number estimation using AIC
  aic_result <- getCellNumber(Y.raw, possibleCellNumber = 2:15)

  # Display results
  cat("Optimal Cell-Type Number (bestK):", aic_result$bestK, "\n")
  cat("AIC Values for Tested Cell Numbers:", aic_result$allAIC, "\n")
  
  
    
    
    ### We evaluated each method's 
       performance by computing the mean Pearson correlation coefficient 
       (MPCC) and mean absolute error (MAE), comparing the estimated proportions 
       to the actual proportions for five distinct cell types. Overall, 
       we found that compared to these methods, 
       the performance of TsisalEXP is comparable to that 
       of reference-based deconvolution methods

    ### The performance of cell type label assignment is commonly affected by noise.
       When we introduce different levels of noise into the reference panel, 
       TsisalEXP is relatively robust to noise and maintains high accuracy in label assignment.
