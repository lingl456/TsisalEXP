\title{Title CornerToEstProp}
\usage{
CornerToEstProp(corner)
}
\arguments{
\item{corner}{A numeric matrix of size N_sample x p, where N_sample is the number of samples and p is the
number of components. Each row represents a sample, and each column corresponds to a component (corner).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of size N_sample x p, where each row represents the estimated proportions for
each sample across the p components. The proportions are normalized to sum to 1 for each sample, and all
values are constrained between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
#' Convert Corner Matrix to Estimated Proportions
}
\details{
This function calculates the estimated proportions for each sample based on the corner matrix obtained
from a previous algorithm (e.g., SISAL). It uses non-negative least squares (NNLS) to estimate the proportions
of the components that best explain each sample.
}
\examples{
# Example usage of CornerToEstProp
corner <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)  # Example corner matrix (10 samples x 10 components)
estProportions <- CornerToEstProp(corner)
