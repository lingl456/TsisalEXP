\usage{
CornerToMarker(distances, topN)
}
\arguments{
\item{distances}{A numeric matrix of size N_genes x p, where N_genes is the number of genes and p is the number of components.
Each element represents the distance between a gene and a component. Smaller values indicate higher similarity between the gene and the component.}

\item{topN}{An integer specifying the number of marker genes to select for each component.}
}
\value{
A list of length p (number of components), where each element is a character vector containing the names of the
top N marker genes for the corresponding component. The marker genes are selected based on the smallest distances for each component.
}
\description{
#' Identify Marker Genes Based on Distances
}
\details{
This function identifies the top N marker genes for each component based on their distances in a given distance matrix.
For each component, the function selects the top N genes with the smallest distance (i.e., most closely related) and
considers them as marker genes.
}
\examples{
# Example usage of CornerToMarker
distances <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)  # Example distance matrix (10 genes x 10 components)
topN <- 3
markerGenes <- CornerToMarker(distances, topN)
