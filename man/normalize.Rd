\usage{
normalize(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of size L x N, where L is the number of genes and N is the number of samples.
Each element represents the expression value of a gene in a sample.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same size as Y, where each element is normalized by dividing it by the sum of its row.
}
\description{
#' Normalize Data Matrix by Row Sums
}
\details{
This function normalizes the input data matrix by dividing each element by the sum of its corresponding row.
This is useful for standardizing gene expression data, where the rows represent genes and columns represent samples.
}
\examples{
# Example usage of the normalize function
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10) # Random example data (100 genes x 10 samples)
normalized_data <- normalize(data)
}
