\usage{
mysisal(Y, K, topN)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A G*N matrix where G is the number of genes, and N is the number of samples. This matrix
represents gene expression data.}

\item{K}{A G*N matrix where G is the number of genes, and N is the number of samples. This matrix
represents gene expression data.}

\item{topN}{The number of top markers to select based on their contribution to the tissue proportions.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{estProp}: A matrix of estimated tissue proportions for each sample.
\item \code{selMarker}: A vector of indices corresponding to the top N markers selected based on the SISAL method.
}
}
\description{
SISAL-based Tissue Proportion Estimation and Marker Selection
}
\details{
This function uses SISAL (Sparse Inverse Simultaneous Component Analysis) to estimate tissue
proportions from gene expression data and to identify the top N markers for each tissue type.
}
\examples{
# Example usage of mysisal function:
Y <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)  # Example gene expression data
K <- 3  # Assume there are 3 tissue types
topN <- 10  # Select top 10 markers
result <- mysisal(Y, K, topN)

# Access the estimated tissue proportions and selected markers
result$estProp
result$selMarker
