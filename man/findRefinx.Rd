\title{Title findRefinx}
\usage{
findRefinx(rawdata, nmarker = 1000, sortBy = "var")
}
\arguments{
\item{rawdata}{A matrix or \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing the raw data.
The rows represent features (genes), and the columns represent samples.
If a \code{SummarizedExperiment} is provided, the raw count data is retrieved from the assay.}

\item{nmarker}{An integer specifying the number of marker features to select based on their variability.
Defaults to 1000.}

\item{sortBy}{A character string specifying the criterion to sort the features by.
Options are "cv" for coefficient of variation or "var" for variance. Defaults to "var".}
}
\value{
A vector of indices corresponding to the top \code{nmarker} most variable features,
sorted according to the selected criterion.
}
\description{
#' Select Marker Features Based on Variance or Coefficient of Variation
}
\details{
This function selects marker features (genes) from a given dataset based on either their
coefficient of variation (CV) or variance. The markers are selected based on their
variability across samples, which can be useful for downstream analysis such as
dimensionality reduction or feature selection.

The function supports both raw count data from RNA sequencing or other types of genomic data
stored as either a matrix or a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object. The features are sorted based on
their variability, and the top \code{nmarker} features are returned.

\examples{
# Example of selecting top 1000 most variable features from a count matrix
rawdata <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)  # Random data for illustration
top_features <- findRefinx(rawdata, nmarker = 1000, sortBy = "var")
top_features  # View the indices of selected features
